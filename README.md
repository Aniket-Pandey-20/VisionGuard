# VisionGuard
VisionGuard is a real-time, multi-camera monitoring dashboard that allows users to register IP/RTSP cameras, view live video streams, and receive instant face-detection alerts. The system is designed with a microservices architecture consisting of a secure backend API(JWT-protected) and a frontend dashboard built with React + TypeScript
